ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Rebecca. A Computer Science Student at UVIC!

I have recently developed huge interest in coding and the aesthetics of algorithms within the past 2-3 years. I enjoy problem solving and the ecstatic feelings that come with it! I have always been a quick learner and an admirer of learning new skills :)

Nice to meet you!
