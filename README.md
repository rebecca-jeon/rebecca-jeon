ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Rebecca. A Computer Science Student at UVIC!

Years ago I have developed a huge interest in coding and the aesthetics of algorithms. I enjoy problem solving and the ecstatic feelings that comes with it! I have always been a quick learner and an admirer of learning new skills :) I hope to showcase many fun coding projects that I  myself have finished or with a group of amazing people on here. 

Nice to meet you!
